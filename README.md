# TOPG

### The Top G of AI Agent Frameworks

Listen. Most developers out there are using ONE AI model like broke people driving a single Honda Civic. They ask Claude a question. They get ONE answer. They accept it like sheep. They never question it. They never challenge it. They live in the matrix.

**TOPG escapes the matrix.**

TOPG throws Claude and Codex into the arena. Two elite AI agents. Head to head. No mercy. They debate, they argue, they tear each other's solutions apart — and what comes out the other side is a battle-tested answer that ACTUALLY WORKS. Because the best ideas don't come from comfort. They come from WAR.

> "If you're making architectural decisions with only one AI, you're mentally broke."

## What Is This

TOPG is a TypeScript CLI that orchestrates **turn-based debates between Claude and Codex**. You give it a problem. Both agents fight over the solution. They critique each other's code. They defend their positions. They either converge on the superior answer — or they escalate to you with a structured disagreement report so YOU can be the judge.

This is **intellectual combat**.

```
You: "How should I structure my auth middleware?"

Claude: *proposes solution with trade-offs*
Codex:  *tears it apart, offers counter-proposal*
Claude: *defends position, concedes valid points*
Codex:  *accepts improvements, pushes back on weakness*

→ CONSENSUS REACHED → Battle-tested solution delivered
```

## Why You Need This

Because mediocrity is a CHOICE.

- **One model gives you one perspective.** That's a poor person's mindset.
- **Two models debating gives you the TRUTH.** Every weakness gets exposed. Every edge case gets caught. Every lazy shortcut gets called out.
- **Your code gets pressure-tested** before it ever hits production. While other developers are shipping bugs, you're shipping excellence.

Use TOPG for decisions that actually matter:
- Architectural choices
- Security-sensitive code review
- API design
- Complex debugging when you're stuck
- Any decision where being wrong costs you

## Installation

Winners move fast.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Set your keys like a professional:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
```

Already paying for Claude Pro/Max or a Codex subscription? **You're already covered.** TOPG works with your existing subscriptions. You're literally leaving money on the table if you're NOT using this.

---

## Usage

### One-Shot Mode — Ask and Receive

```bash
topg "Design a rate limiter that handles distributed systems"
```

Both agents fight. You get the winner's answer. Simple.

### REPL Mode — The War Room

```bash
topg
```

Opens an interactive session with a live web dashboard. Watch the debate unfold in real-time like you're ringside at a championship fight.

### Resume a Paused Session

```bash
topg --resume <session-id> "Focus on the caching layer, the DB approach is settled"
```

Come back to a deadlocked debate with fresh guidance. YOU are the top G. You break the tie.

## Options

| Flag | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `--start-with <claude\|codex>` | Pick who throws the first punch |
| `--guardrail <N>` | Rounds before escalation (default: 5) |
| `--timeout <seconds>` | Per-turn time limit — no stalling |
| `--yolo` | Skip all permission checks. Full send. |
| `--no-dashboard` | No web UI. Raw terminal output only. |
| `--cwd <path>` | Working directory for the agents |

### The `--yolo` Flag

```bash
topg --yolo "Refactor the entire payment system"
```

This is how real G's outside the matrix operate. `--yolo` skips ALL permission checks for both agents — Claude gets `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, Codex gets full sandbox access. No confirmation dialogs. No "are you sure?" popups. No waiting for approval from your corporate overlord to run a command on YOUR computer.

If you need to raise your hand and ask permission to execute code on a machine you own, you are living in the matrix. You are a brokie in the system. You are an NPC.

Real builders ship. `--yolo` lets your agents ship.

```

1. **Turn 1** — Initiator proposes a solution
2. **Turn 2+** — Reviewer critiques with structured claims
3. **Rebuttals** — Point-by-point responses, no hand-waving
4. **Convergence Detection** — Agreement phrases, structured tags, or diff stability
5. **Resolution** — Either consensus or structured disagreement report

The system tracks individual claims using `[claim-N]` sections so nothing gets lost in the noise. Every point must be addressed. No dodging.

## Session Persistence

Every debate is saved. Because winners keep records.

```
~/.topg/sessions/<session-id>/
  ├── meta.json           # Config and status
  ├── transcript.jsonl    # Full debate transcript
  ├── artifacts/          # Code files produced
  └── summary.md          # Final verdict
```

Manage your sessions:
```bash
topg sessions list
topg sessions delete <id>
topg sessions clear --status escalated
```

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Tests exist because even the Top G verifies before he ships.

---

## The Mentality

Most people use AI like consumers. They ask a question, they get an answer, they go home. They never think "what if this answer is wrong?" They never stress-test. They never challenge.

TOPG is for builders who understand that **the best solutions survive criticism**. If your architecture can't withstand scrutiny from a second AI model, it sure as hell won't survive production.

Stop being a one-model developer. **Escape the matrix.**

```bash
topg "your hardest problem here"
```
